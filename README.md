# Minh Thu Do - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm Minh Thu and you can call me Helen! I am a final year student doing a Bachelor of Commerce and a Bachelor of Information Systems at The University of New South Wales, majoring in Business Analytics. During my studies, I have gained experience in using various tools and technologies to collect, transform, and analyse data to provide data-driven insights to businesses. I am proficient in R, Oracle SQL, Python, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, and have a solid understanding of data analytics techniques such as data visualisation, data modelling, and dashboard building. I recently completed an internship at Aurecon Sydney as an Asset Management and Performance Consulting intern in May 2024.

In this portfolio, I have included a variety of projects that showcase my data analytics skills. You will find links to dashboards, reports, and coding components that demonstrate my ability to extract valuable insights from complex datasets and present them in a visually appealing way, making it easy for decision-makers to understand and take action.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Analysing the Gender-based Violence Landscape in Kenya
**Link:** https://github.com/helen030/GBVProject/blob/794a2077d183312d4d5ac57f1058e59d5f734349/README.md

**Goal:** To understand factors contributing to gender-based violence (GBV) incidents in Kenya and to recommend a set of actions to combat the situations based on these findings.

**Description:** The project focused on analysing a dataset of GBV cases in Kenya from 2017 to 2019. The dataset included the reported case ID, the victim's demographic, geographical areas, reporting details, and other relevant information. The project involved extracting the data, transforming it and loading it into Power BI. Then descriptive data analysis was performed to provide insights into the following topics:
- Pinpoint geographical areas and temporal patterns where GBV incidents are more prevalent.
- Analyse the correlation between reported cases and victims' age and gender.
- Assess the effectiveness of existing prevention programs and allocation of resources.

**Technical Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, data visualisation, data storytelling, and dashboard building.

**Technology:** Power BI, Excel.

**Results:** Using Power BI functions the analysis revealed that age and location are major contributing factors causing increases in vulnerability for GBV victims. In addition, GBV incidents spiked on weekdays, particularly Mondays, and a significant proportion of them involved intimate partners and occurred within households behind closed doors.

**Goal:** To understand factors that affect the sales performance of pain relief drugs in the market and help our client Poon differentiate their Joint and Muscle Pain Gel products.

**Description:** The data used in this project was consolidated through multiple datasets on Kaggle. These datasets contained sales of available medications, price ranges, customer ratings and reviews, reported side effects, and other relevant information. The following steps were performed to prepare the data: data sourcing, cleansing, and pre-processing. Then, prescriptive and predictive analytics, and data modelling techniques such as Monte-Carlo simulation were leveraged for success prediction. 

**Technical Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, data modelling, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python.

**Results:** Findings from generated models suggested that women are the primary consumers and appropriate pricing is the most significant factor impacting sales in the pain relief market. In addition, clear communication about the list of used ingredients, potential side effects and expected benefits is important to experience product success. 

### Customer Churn Rate Analysis of an American Telecommunication Company

**Goal:** To understand customer behaviour and to accurately predict customer churn.

**Description:** The client in this project is a major U.S. wireless telecommunication company that provides cellular telephone service. The data provides details of 30,000 customers in the training dataset, and 10,000 customers in the evaluation dataset. There is information on 44 attributes describing the customer care service details, customer demography and personal details, etc. Extra analysis related to churn prediction based on the Kaggel datasets was used as an example for this project.

**Technical Skills:** Data manipulation, data cleaning, descriptive data analysis, statistical modelling, web app development and hosting.

**Technology:** R

**Results:**

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Analysing the Gender-based Violence Landscape in Kenya
**Code:** [`Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie.ipynb`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Analyzing%20the%20Factors%20Contributing%20to%20the%20Success%20of%20a%20Movie.ipynb)

**Goal:** To understand contributing factors to gender vulnerability and to identify hotspots and trends in gender-based violence (GBV) incidents.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of GBV cases in Kenya from 2017 to 2019. The dataset included the reported case ID, the victim's demographic, geographical areas, reporting details, and other relevant information. The project involved extracting the data, transforming it and loading it into Power BI. Then descriptive data analysis was performed to provide insights into the following topics:
- Pinpoint geographical areas and temporal patterns where GBV incidents are more prevalent.
- Analyse the correlation between reported cases and victims' age and gender.
- Assess the effectiveness of existing prevention programs and allocation of resources.

**Technical Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, data storytelling.

**Technology:** Power BI, Excel.

**Results:** Using Power BI functions the analysis revealed that age and location are major contributing factors causing increases in vulnerability for GBV victims. In addition, GBV incidents spiked on weekdays, particularly Mondays, and a significant proportion of them involved intimate partners and occurred within households behind closed doors.

### Comparison of Muscle Pain Relief Medications in the Hong Kong market
**Code:** [`Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie.ipynb`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Analyzing%20the%20Factors%20Contributing%20to%20the%20Success%20of%20a%20Movie.ipynb)

**Goal:** To understand factors that affect the sales performance of pain relief drugs in the market and help our client Poon differentiate their Joint and Muscle Pain Gel products.

**Description:** The data used in this project was consolidated through multiple datasets on Kaggle. These datasets contained sales of available medications, price ranges, customer ratings and reviews, reported side effects, and other relevant information. The following steps were performed to prepare the data: data sourcing, cleansing, and pre-processing. Then, prescriptive and predictive analytics, and data modelling techniques such as Monte-Carlo simulation were leveraged for success prediction. 

**Technical Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, data modelling, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python.

**Results:** Findings from generated models suggested that women are the primary consumers and appropriate pricing is the most significant factor impacting sales in the pain relief market. In addition, clear communication about the list of used ingredients, potential side effects and expected benefits is important to experience product success. 

### Customer Churn Rate Analysis of an American Telecommunication Company
**Code:** [`Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie.ipynb`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Analyzing%20the%20Factors%20Contributing%20to%20the%20Success%20of%20a%20Movie.ipynb)

**Goal:** To understand customer behaviour and to accurately predict customer churn.

**Description:** The client in this project is a major U.S. wireless telecommunication company that provides cellular telephone service. The data provides details of 30,000 customers in the training dataset, and 10,000 customers in the evaluation dataset. There is information on 44 attributes describing the customer care service details, customer demography and personal details, etc. Extra analysis related to churn prediction based on the Kaggel datasets was used as an example for this project.

**Technical Skills:** Data manipulation, data cleaning, descriptive data analysis, statistical modelling, web app development and hosting.

**Technology:** R

**Results:**
